                    <p>I studied here in Nursery & roamed around multiple gov school with 
                        uncertainty until I joined grade 1, years later in above mentioned date.

                    <p>I joined them starting grade 4 and it was quite long way from my home and most of my time was spend commuting</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Pokhara University</h3>
                    <p>After a year gap with unsucessful foreign study attempt, I joined them for Software Engineering. That ? is not only because
                        I am currently in this phase but because of uncertainty and unreliablity of this University to run efficiently.
